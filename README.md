# 🧑‍💻 Learner Projects

This repository is my **personal collection of machine learning and AI projects**.
It serves as a learning playground where I experiment with **ML, Deep Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Reinforcement Learning**.

The projects are mostly **small, focused implementations** to understand concepts, architectures, and algorithms from scratch.

---

## 🚀 What's Inside

Projects span across:

* **Machine Learning** – classical models & pipelines.
* **Deep Learning** – neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, attention-based models.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – embeddings, transformers, sequence-to-sequence models.
* **Generative AI** – minimal transformers, text generation, toy LLMs.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – agents, environments, and exploration of RL algorithms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:** PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (varies by project)
* **Tools:** Git, VSCode, Jupyter

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* Build **end-to-end understanding** of ML → DL → NLP → GenAI → RL.
* Implement **fundamental architectures from scratch** before using large frameworks.
* Document experiments clearly for future reference & sharing.

## 🔗 How to Use

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Learner_Projects.git
cd Learner_Projects
```

Each project will have:

* Its own folder (with code + README + results).
* Training & test scripts.
* Explanations of what was implemented.

👉 Do you want me to also **add a section at the bottom for a planned roadmap** (like a checklist of projects you’ll be adding: e.g., LSTM from scratch, GPT mini, RL CartPole agent, etc.), so people see what’s coming next?
